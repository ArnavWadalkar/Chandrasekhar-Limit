# The Chandrasekhar Limit: A Exploration into White Dwarf Collapse

This article reviews the physics of white dwarf stability, exploring how Fermi degeneracy, gravitational equilibrium, and relativistic effects define the Chandrasekhar Limit. It is aimed at undergraduate students of theoretical and astrophysical physics.

## Article Overview

The article is divided into the following sections:

1. **White Dwarfs and Stellar Equilibrium**  
   Discusses the lifecycle of stars and how white dwarfs emerge from stellar collapse.

2. **Degeneracy Pressure and Quantum Mechanics**  
   Explains the origin of degeneracy pressure using the Pauli Exclusion Principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics.

3. **Relativistic Corrections**  
   Introduces why relativistic treatment is necessary for high-density electron gases and how the equation of state changes.

4. **Hydrostatic Equilibrium and Lane-Emden Equation**  
   Shows how the pressure-density balance is modeled and solved in stellar interiors.

5. **Derivation of the Chandrasekhar Mass Limit**  
   Full derivation from fundamental physics, highlighting scaling relations, limiting behaviors, and the final result.

6. **Collapse Physics and Instabilities**  
   Details what happens once the limit is breached â€” inverse beta decay, electron capture, and onset of core collapse.

7. **Astrophysical Implications**  
   Covers the relevance in supernovae, neutron star formation, and the criticality of weak interactions.
